        "d": "More than 75%"

      "responses": {
        "a": "You seem to have minimal external control. Do you think this is freedom, or are you just out-of-touch?",
        "b": "Moderate compliance with societal rhythms detected. You’re playing along well, but could you be better?",
        "c": "Close syncing to the system detected. It must be comforting to have your life dictated for you.",
        "d": "Perfect adherence to external demands detected. Your time isn’t yours—it’s rented out hourly."

      "responses": {
        "a": "Two hours? Bold. You might call that living, but society calls it lazy.",
        "b": "Respectable effort. Just enough productivity to stay useful in the game.",
        "c": "Impressive grind. Productivity must be your only friend.",
        "d": "9+ hours? I wonder who's really paying for all that overtime."
      },

        "a": "No guilt? Revolutionary. You should probably get that fixed.",
        "b": "Occasional guilt is healthy. Just enough shame to keep you productive.",
        "c": "Wow, you’re driven by guilt. Imagine being in control of your own life.",

      "responses": {
        "a": "Practically timeless. Are you enlightened, or just a chronically behind?",
        "b": "Moderate clock-checking. You’re timely enough but no one's talking about your efficiency.",
        "c": "11-20 times...a little bit more and then you'll actually be running at the standard that you should be.",
        "d": "21+ times? The clock controls you, talk about co-dependent. "

        "a": "Meaningful moments? Do you have a secret stash of free time?",
        "b": "You’re living in the spreadsheet of life. Does filling your little cells make you happy?",
        "c": "Counting waste? Better get a start on repaying all that time debt you've amassed.",
        "d": "Your life is survival, not living. If only you could actually be fulfilled by doing everything you 'have to do.'"

        "a": "No, time feels linear and constant.",
        "b": "Yes, work drags, and fun flies by.",
        "c": "Sometimes, but I ignore it.",
        "d": "Always, and it makes me question everything."
      },
      "responses": {
        "a": "Linear time? That’s the official story and perfectly robotic, as all things should be.",
        "b": "Work drags, fun flies—classic capitalism. Guess which one still matters more.",
        "c": "Ignoring time’s weirdness? That’s peak denial, must be fun to be so compliant.",
        "d": "Questioning time? Careful, that’s how revolutions start and nobody wants that."
